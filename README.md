# YouTube Comment Enhancer

üìù TODO: (Listed in order of importance, most important first)

*   **(really hard) Profile Cards info box:** (support.google.com/youtube/answer/9409333) Very helpful information like total hearts, total comments, and special status (if available, like Top Commenter) are tucked away, only accessible by clicking the commenter's profile picture. Why not put all of them in info boxes?
*   **(easy, but feels unnecessary) Profile Picture Preview on Hover:** Hover over a commenter‚Äôs profile image to see a larger version, without the round overlay. Planning to add banner alongside it if possible.

üöÄ Features:

*   **Subscriber Count:** See how many subscribers the commenter has.
*   **Location:** Shows the country of the commenter (if they set their location in their about page).
*   **Total Videos:** Displays the total number of videos uploaded to the commenter's YouTube channel.
*   **Latest Video's Views and Upload Date:** Displays the amount of views and upload date of the commenter's latest public video.
*   **Automatically hides info box(es) if data is unavailable.**
*   **Sorts info boxes into 3 columns for readability:**
    *   **Left:** Subscriber Count, Location, and Channel Creation Date (WIP)
    *   **Middle:** Total Videos, Latest Video's Views and Upload Date
    *   **Right:** Profile Cards (WIP)
*   **Updates dynamically, even if comment section is set to Newest.**
